            What is Artificial Intelligence?
        </p1>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence is the theory and development of
            computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require
            human intelligence. They are theoretically supposed to perform
            actions such as driving cars, manufacturing, teaching, and
            other actions. The term artificial intelligence was first
            coined by John McCarthy in 1956 when he held the first academic
            conference on the subject. John McCarthy is known as the “father”
            of AI. His objective in his research was to explore if machines
            could reason like humans.  He created the Lisp computer Language,
            which was the first standard AI programming Language. He also
            conceived the idea of computer time-sharing or networking, which
            paved the way for the development of the internet.

            Last Five Years
        </p1>
        <p>
            The last five years has seen an extraordinary rapid increase in technology.
            There two different kinds of AI technology are Narrow AI and General AI. All
            artificial technology is existence now is Narrow AI. Narrow AIs are program
            to do a specific task, like play chess or select best music for a user. However,
            the goal of Artificial Intelligence is to reach General AI. Which are AIs that
            are not limited to a single task. They are able to reason and reach logical solutions
            without human interference. They have the capability to work non-stop without need
            for rest or food.

            What the future Hold
        </p1>
        <p>
            Smart technologies aren’t just changing our homes; they’re edging their way into their numerous industries and
            are disrupting the workplace. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve productivity, efficiency
            and accuracy across an organization – but is this entirely beneficial? Many fear that the rise of AI will lead to
            machines and robots replacing human workers and view this progression in technology as threat rather than a tool
            to better ourselves.
